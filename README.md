## I am a complete noob wanting to learn:

The goal was to deploy this repo on my homelab Server so I can deploy, edit, pull, and monitor this application. It is a vibe coded CRM for my small Seasoning Company. I built it around the needs that I had when searching for a CRM and counldn't find. 

### Successfully deployed using Node.js. 

# **This is a resume building project
